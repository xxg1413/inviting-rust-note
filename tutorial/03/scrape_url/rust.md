Rust
==========

 A language empowering everyone   
 to build reliable and efficient software.

[ Get Started ](/learn/get-started)

[Version 1.56.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0.html)

 Why Rust?
----------

### Performance ###

 Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or
garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on
embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

### Reliability ###

 Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety
and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of
bugs at compile-time.

### Productivity ###

 Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error
messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager
and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and
type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

 Build it in Rust
----------

 In 2018, the Rust community decided to improve programming experience
for a few distinct domains (see [the 2018
roadmap](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html)). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some
awesome guides on how to get started.

###  Command Line  ###

 Whip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem.
Rust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease.

###  WebAssembly  ###

 Use Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time.
Publish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races.

[Writing Web Apps](/what/wasm)

###  Networking  ###

 Predictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability.
Rust is great for network services.

###  Embedded  ###

 Targeting low-resource devices?
Need low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences?
Rust has you covered.

Rust in production
----------

 Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production
today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know
and love, like [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/),[Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/),
and [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/),
uses Rust. **From startups to large
corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.**

>  My biggest compliment to Rust is that it's boring, and this is an amazing compliment.
